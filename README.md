# JARGON

Jargon is a simple re-implementation of docker in java. It a work in progress model and is not ready for use.Original docker is written in go, so as a fun project to learn more about java we started this project. 


[*] Things to do

-- Add a file format to create new containers
-- Implement shell interaction rather than using sudo su in command


[*] Features

-- New runtime namespace other than os
-- New subnetwork
-- Volumes


[*] Bugs



Jargon stands for Java adapted  Generating Orchestration Nodes. If it's doesn't wok and it made you angry, then its "Just another Runtime Generating Outrageous Nonsense (and a bunch of bullshit)".
